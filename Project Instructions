This is a JavaScript Project, the focus should be on JavaScript but you may have HTML and CSS in your project if you would like

Your project NEEDs to have interactivity built into it
It should provide some USEFUL and INTERESTING functionality

Your project functions should NOT just be “hard-coded”, they should be programmatic and actually reusable or dynamic (if you don’t know how to do this I can work with you on this in class code reviews)

Various Project ideas:
    Simulations
    Animations (preferably with some amount of user interaction)
    The essence of calculus
    Small Games
    Text based adventure games

Other easily scalable simple games like 
    pong
    invaders
    asteroids
    Space invaders
    Shooters

Other various simple games

Small Apps or widgets or Components
Some kind of Chrome Extension or addon

Something that integrates with Google Sheets or some other APIs (if you want a bit of a challenge since we didn’t really cover fetch syntax yet)

Automations (building interesting automations and scripts with airtable.com)

Send out emails

Create forms or PDFs from a database


Pick something that YOU are topically interested in
Math/ Science/ Nature/Music / Games / hobbies/ lifegoals etc


Your project does not need to be a large application (this is hard to build without a JavaScript Framework, and impossible to build in a short time frame with only 1 or 2 beginners)

You may use any JavaScript Libraries you would like, including Frameworks if you so choose

I HIGHLY recommend using p5.js for this project, it will make your life and the UI side of the project much easier

Please pick something interesting or make something that is simple/bland more interesting

i.e. don’t just build a basic calculator from a tutorial and give a presentation and tell me “It’s a calculator, it can do basic math functions”  since this pretty much provides almost no additional utility than the base language provides.

Avoid spending a lot of time on HTML and CSS issues, this is not the primary focus of the project and can eat up a lot of time
